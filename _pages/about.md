_Hi_, I am researcher working on agents and coding with large language models. I finished my Ph.D. at [the OSU NLP Group](https://x.com/osunlp?s=09), advised by Dr. [Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/) and worked closely with Dr. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). Before that, I received a B.Eng. in Computer Science from [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu). In the past, I have had the opportunity to work with many wonderful industrial collaborators from [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/people/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/), [Google](https://research.google/) and Scale AI.

# Research

My research interests lie in NLP and artificial intelligence in general, with emphasis on utilizing knowledge from heterogeneous sources and developing practical applications with AI. The aim is to build AI-powered systems/agents that can assist with decision-making and daily tasks for regular users as well as domain experts in Digital Era. Specifically, I am interested in the following directions:

- **Large-scale pretraining and representation learning** for data from heterogeneous sources (plain text, structured data, code, images, etc); both for general and domain-specific applications; and learning beyond next token prediction.
- **Natural language agents** with varied data, services and environments. Building practical agents that are accessible and collaborative to the user, and generalist agents that are efficient and robust.

My recent work has been focusing on large language models, how to understand and improve their capabilities at different stages of training, how to make them ground and act in the real world, and how to build applications around LLMs that are collaborative, trustworthy and accessible to users.
